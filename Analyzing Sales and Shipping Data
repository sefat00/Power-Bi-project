Now I explain that visualization-


The first photo-
1.Sum of Boxes Shipped by Country:
This visualization focuses on the total number of boxes shipped to different countries.
Key Insights:
The graph compares shipping volumes across countries like the USA, UK, India, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
Countries with taller bars (e.g., USA) indicate higher shipping volumes, while shorter bars (e.g., New Zealand) suggest lower volumes.
This helps identify which regions are key markets for the business.
Use Case:
This analysis can optimize logistics and distribution strategies by focusing on high-demand regions.


The second photo:
2.Sum of Amount by Year, Quarter, and Month:
This visualization tracks the total amount (likely revenue or sales) over time, broken down by year, quarter, and month.
Key Insights:
Monthly Trends — The graph tracks 2022 trends, with amounts reaching up to 0.9M.
Highs & Lows — Some months (e.g., January) show peak amounts, while others (e.g., February) see declines.
Seasonal Patterns — Helps identify periods of strong and weak performance.
Use Case:
This analysis helps businesses understand revenue patterns and prepare for seasonal changes.


The third photo:
3.Sum of Boxes Shipped by Product:
This graph breaks down the total number of boxes shipped by product.
Key Insights:
Products like Dark Bites (9.8K boxes) and Smooth Silky S… (8.8K boxes) are the top performers in terms of shipping volume.
Other products, such as Drinking Coco and Milk Bars, show moderate shipping volumes.
This helps identify which products are in high demand and which may need more marketing or distribution efforts.
Use Case:
Businesses can use this data to prioritize high-performing products and improve inventory management.



The fourth photo:
4.Sum of Amount by Year, Quarter, Month, and Product:
This graph provides a more detailed view of the total amount, broken down by time periods and products.


Key Insights:
Some products, like Milk Bars and 85% Dark Bars, show consistent performance.
However, there are noticeable decreases in certain months (e.g., February 2022), with negative values like -0.14M.
Possible reasons for the decline include underperforming products (e.g., 99% Dark & Pure) or external market factors.
Use Case:
This helps businesses pinpoint underperforming products or periods and take corrective actions.
